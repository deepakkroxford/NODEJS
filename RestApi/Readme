The line app.use(express.json()); in an Express.js application enables middleware that parses incoming JSON request payloads and makes the parsed data accessible in req.body. Here's an explanation of what it does and why it's necessary:

What express.json() Does
Middleware:

It is a built-in middleware function in Express that parses JSON data in the body of incoming HTTP requests.
The parsed JSON object is then attached to the req.body property.
Parsing JSON:

When a client sends a request with a Content-Type of application/json and includes a JSON payload, this middleware processes that payload and converts it into a JavaScript object.
Automatic Handling:

Without this middleware, req.body will be undefined for JSON payloads because Express does not parse the request body by default.


## What is RestApi and how is it different from a normal API?

### REST API (Representational State Transfer API):

- REST is an architectural style for designing networked applications.
- It relies on a stateless, client-server, cacheable communications protocol -- the HTTP.
- In RESTful applications, resources are identified by URLs, and actions are performed using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- REST APIs are designed to be simple, scalable, and flexible, making them suitable for a wide range of applications.

### Normal API:

- The term "normal API" is quite broad and can refer to any type of API (Application Programming Interface) that allows software applications to communicate with each other.
- APIs can be based on various protocols and architectures, such as SOAP, GraphQL, gRPC, etc.
- Unlike REST APIs, other types of APIs may not follow the REST principles and can have different ways of handling requests and responses.

### Key Differences:

- REST APIs use standard HTTP methods and status codes, while other APIs may use different protocols and methods.
- REST APIs are stateless, meaning each request from a client contains all the information needed to process the request,
   whereas other APIs may maintain state between requests.
- REST APIs use URLs to identify resources, while other APIs may use different mechanisms for resource identification.
