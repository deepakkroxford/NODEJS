# what is Repl ?


REPL in Node.js stands for Read-Eval-Print Loop. It is an interactive shell environment that allows you to execute JavaScript code and see the results immediately. REPL is particularly useful for testing and debugging small snippets of code quickly.

Breakdown of REPL :-

Read: The REPL reads the input provided by the user.
Eval: The input is evaluated as JavaScript code.
Print: The result of the evaluation is printed to the console.
Loop: The process repeats, allowing you to execute additional commands.

How to Start REPL:
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Type node and press Enter.
Youâ€™ll see a prompt (>) indicating the REPL environment is active.
